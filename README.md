# Youri's Travel Atlas

**Live website:** [https://ywarmelink.github.io/YourAtlas/](https://ywarmelink.github.io/YourAtlas/)

A personal travel dashboard built with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Part of the YourIntineryPlan ecosystem.

## Data

Live data is pulled from a public Google Sheets spreadsheet (CSV). Fallback JSON files are in `data/youri/` when the sheet is unreachable.

**Route Builder is the exception**: it stores big, multi-country routes in `localStorage`
only (per browser, per device) — it doesn't touch the Google Sheet yet. There's a
concrete plan to change that in [`ROUTE_BUILDER_SYNC.md`](ROUTE_BUILDER_SYNC.md) —
new sheet tabs, Apps Script changes, client code — pick it up whenever you're ready
to make routes sync across devices.

## Route Builder

Plan long, multi-country "expeditions" by stacking country blocks in sequence — for
trips that span months, not weeks. Lives at `route-builder.html`.

- **Country blocks**: country, days, budget, free-form notes, and a "Transport to
  next" field (how you get from this country to the next one in the sequence — flight,
  overland bus, ferry, etc). Day ranges (Day 1–17, Day 18–25, …) compute automatically
  from the sequence — reorder blocks with ↑/↓ and the ranges shift with them.
- **Regional Blocks**: group a contiguous run of country blocks under a collapsible,
  named header with its own season, budget estimate and notes (e.g. "Balkans" = 5
  countries as one unit). Assign a block to a region via the dropdown on that block.
- **Destinations**: an optional free-form list of places (+ notes) per country block —
  this is where the specific cities/sights for that country live (e.g. "Petra",
  "Wadi Rum" under Jordan), separate from the country-level Note field.
- **Expedition details**: Status (Idea / Planning / Active / Completed), Travel
  Style, Best Starting Month, Description, Climate Summary, and route-wide Notes.
- **Calendar view**: set an optional start date to see the route laid out on real
  month grids, colored by country.
- **World map view**: highlights the route's countries on the same Leaflet world map
  `map.html` uses (shared lookup table in `js/utils/isoCountries.js`).
- **Route-line map view**: a second map mode ("📍 Routelijn" next to "🌍 Landen")
  that draws the route as an actual ordered path — a dashed line connecting one anchor
  coordinate per leg, with a numbered, color-coded marker per stop, starting and ending
  at a fixed Utrecht/Netherlands home marker. See `rbRenderRouteLine()` in
  `js/pages/routeBuilder.js`.
- **Block Library**: save a route as a reusable, named group of countries; insert it
  into any other route later (as an independent copy — editing one never affects the
  other), or merge 2+ saved blocks into a new combined block.

Thirteen predefined routes, all with real content and all price/visa/travel-advisory
verified as of 2026-07 (see `CHANGELOG.md` for the verification history):

**Eurasia Grand Tour 🌏**, **Pan-American Grand Tour 🌎**, **Africa Grand Tour 🌍**,
**Mediterranean Civilizations Expedition 🏛️**, **Nordic Arctic Expedition ❄️**,
**Patagonia & Antarctica Expedition 🧊**, **India & Himalaya Expedition 🏔️**,
**North America Grand Traverse 🌎**, **Oceania Grand Expedition 🌊**,
**Caribbean & Amazon Expedition 🌴**, **West & Central Africa Expedition 🌍**,
**Central European Grand Roadtrip 🚗**, and **British Isles & Celtic Coast
Expedition 🍀**.

Everything above lives in `localStorage` (`atlas_grand_trips`,
`atlas_route_blocks_library`) — see [`ROUTE_BUILDER_SYNC.md`](ROUTE_BUILDER_SYNC.md)
for the plan to move it into the Google Sheet.

## Open items

- **Sheet sync still not started** — routes don't follow you across devices/browsers
  yet (see `ROUTE_BUILDER_SYNC.md` for the full plan). **Next concrete step**: in the
  Google Sheet, add 4 new tabs (`GrandTrips`, `GrandTripRegions`, `GrandTripBlocks`,
  `GrandTripDestinations` — exact columns in `ROUTE_BUILDER_SYNC.md`) and publish each
  to the web as CSV, then extend the Apps Script `doPost` for `GrandTrip*` payloads.
- **Eurasia Grand Tour is a genuinely long expedition (~11-12 months)** even after the
  time-realism audit. Worth considering splitting it into two separate expeditions
  (West-Eurasia through Central Asia, and East Asia/Southeast Asia through Indonesia)
  rather than one continuous year. Not started, no date set.
- **Route-line view precision** — see `CLAUDE.md`'s gotcha note. Natural next steps if
  worth refining further: per-destination coordinates for more accurate shapes, and/or
  a routing API so the line follows real roads instead of straight lines. Not started.

See `CLAUDE.md` for smaller cosmetic gaps (map highlighting, dropdown lag) that are accepted as-is rather than open work.

## Architecture

```
js/config/users.js      ← User configuration (multi-user ready)
js/data/dataService.js  ← Single data abstraction layer
js/data/csvParser.js    ← CSV parser
js/utils/                ← Shared helpers (flags, dates, ISO country codes)
js/components/          ← Navbar + footer
js/pages/               ← Per-page logic
```
